    <h1>Values and methodology</h1>
    <p>Value: Reduced marketing costs. The operation of the company requires publicity and promotion. The traditional
        offline publicity and promotion method costs a lot, while entering the third-party e-commerce platform requires
        high deduction points and promotion fees, which is difficult for small enterprises to afford. And the self-built
        shopping website, marketing and promotion is much more convenient, you can promote yourself through SEO,
        exchange chain, brand cooperation, preferential activities and other diversified marketing methods. And shopping
        website construction costs are also low, generally only a few hundred to more than two thousand a year, more
        suitable for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>



    <p>Approach: Better communication with customers. When people want to know the new products or services of a certain
        enterprise, or want to know the news of the enterprise, or need to submit feedback, they may habitually enter
        the website of the enterprise. Through the website, enterprises can better communicate with customers and timely
        understand customer opinions. In addition, a plain text section can be added to the site to answer customers'
        frequently asked questions so that customers can learn more about the brand</p>
